# Quantum Computing Patents Analysis

## Introduction to Quantum Patent Landscape

The quantum computing field has seen rapid growth with patents covering:
- Qubit design and stability
- Quantum error correction methods  
- Quantum algorithm optimization

## Mathematical Model of Qubit Dynamics

The Schr√∂dinger equation for a single qubit:

$$
i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t}|\psi(t)\rangle = H|\psi(t)\rangle
$$

Where $H$ is the Hamiltonian operator describing the system's energy.
